👋 Hi, I’m Anna @annawritesgood  
🐍 I’m currently learning data analytics with Python. I started learning Python in 2022 on Codecademy and I'm passionate about it!   
💘 I’m looking for feedback on my Python portfolio. I'm also looking to learn about best practices for both programming and data analytics, since I don't have formal training in either.
